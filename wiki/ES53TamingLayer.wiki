#summary ES5/3 taming layer

= Introduction =

This is a quick description of some aspects of the ES5/3 taming layer. This layer is implemented in [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/es53.js es53.js].

= General design =

Our taming layer is an objective membrane. It is a _membrane_ because it wraps the entire API reachable from a tamed object, allowing functions in that API to be called but unwrapping and wrapping, respectively, their arguments and return value. It is _objective_ because, to each feral object, it assigns exactly one tamed object, and all Caja clients of the feral object receive the same tamed object.
