= Effect =

Any program containing a public properties containing a underscore suffix is rejected.

freely mutated by any other object with access to it.  As a result an
object does not have a place to maintain data safe from another
objects possible misbehaviour.

In Caja a property ending in a single underscore in caja is considered
an internal property and thus can only be accessed via {{{this}}}.
