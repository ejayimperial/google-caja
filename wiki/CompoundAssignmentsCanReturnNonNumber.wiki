#summary Compound assignment expressions might not evaluate to a number (or string in the case of +=), in violation of the ES3 specification. Simple assignments might not evaluate to their right-hand-side.
#labels Attack-Vector

== Effect ==

Properties that should not be readable may be read (and possibly written). It may be possible to combine this with other attack vectors such as EvalArbitraryCodeExecution to run arbitrary code.


== Assumptions ==

  * In a !JavaScript subset, properties named by stringified numbers are implicitly readable (and possibly writable).
  * The subset implementation assumes that a compound assignment expression other than += always evaluates to a number, or that += evaluates to a (number or string), or that a simple assignment evaluates to its right-hand-side.
  * The !JavaScript interpreter incorrectly implements assignments, so that they may return a value that has been coerced to a different type.
  * An object that performs such a coercion when its properties are assigned is directly accessible to code written in the subset language (either untrusted code, or a tamed API implementation that can be exploited as a confused deputy).
  * The subset allows !LeftHandSideExpressions that might refer to a property of such an object.


== Background ==

The compound assignment operators (+=, `*`=, /=, %=, -=, <<=, >>=, >>>=, &=, ^=, |=) are specified to return the value computed by the corresponding operator. This should always be a number, or a (number or string) in the case of +=. Caja, ADsafe, and Jacaranda unconditionally allow reading of properties named by "stringified numbers", that is, strings that can be the result of !ToString(!ToNumber(x)) for some x.

However, in some versions of !SpiderMonkey, if `obj.prop `_op_`= rhs` is a compound assignment then for certain properties `obj.prop`, the assigned value `obj.prop `_op_` rhs` can be coerced to a value of a different type, which is then incorrectly used as the result of the assignment operator. (The problem is not the coercion, but the fact that the assignment evaluates to the coerced value.) See [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312354 Mozilla bug 312354].

For example, `typeof(window.location += '')` or `typeof(window.location -= 0)` will return `'object'`, when they should return `'string'`. This happens because the `window` object coerces its `location` property to type object.

This means that a property access of the form `a[x.prop -= 0]`, for example, might be allowed under the assumption that it is accessing a stringified number property, but actually access a different property that should not have been readable (or writable when the access is a !LeftHandSideExpression).

The same problem occurs for a simple assignment, if the subset implementation assumes that simple assignments evaluate to their right-hand-side.

The potential for an exploit is limited by the fact that most secure subsets attempt not to grant direct access to host objects. However, even some non-host objects, such as !RegExp objects, have coercing properties in !SpiderMonkey.

The same result can be achieved with  
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch  
a watcher] on non-host objects in !SpiderMonkey (see example below); however, most subsets block the `'watch'` method.

In Jacaranda, this issue is not exploitable (despite the fact that !RegExp objects are accessible) because only local variables and properties of `this` can be used as !LeftHandSideExpressions, and `this` must refer to an object created by an object literal.

In Caja and ADsafe, it is not exploitable because currently there is no reliance on compound assignments evaluating to a number or simple assignments evaluating to their right-hand-side. (CHECK for Caja) (CHECK for ADsafe)


== Versions ==
  * !SpiderMonkey in Firefox 3.0.4 and earlier.
  * Apparently fixed in !SpiderMonkey trunk.


== Examples ==

{{{
  foo[window.location -= 0];     // accesses a property of foo named by the current URL
}}}
{{{
  (<xml/>.x = 0) + 0;            // returns "00", not 0 (depends on E4X)
}}}
{{{
  typeof (/a/.lastIndex = "7");  // returns "number", not "string"
}}}
{{{
  var obj = {};
  obj.watch(
      'foo',
      function (prop, oldval, newval) {
        return typeof newval === 'number' && isNaN(newval) ? oldval : newval;
      });
  obj.foo = 'foo';
  (obj.foo -= 1);  // returns 'foo', not NaN
}}}
