= Output Checks =

The HTML, CSS, and Javascript that we output should be as clear as simple as possible to make sure that browsers produce the same parse tree.

Below are some properties that we can assert on output.


== Intentional Newlines ==

Our source code formatter should not output any non-space tokens containing any of the characters listed in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline]
  * LF:    Line Feed, U+000A
  * CR:    Carriage Return, U+000D
  * CR+LF: CR followed by LF, U+000D followed by U+000A
  * NEL:   Next Line, U+0085
  * FF:    Form Feed, U+000C
  * LS:    Line Separator, U+2028
  * PS:    Paragraph Separator, U+2029


== Comment Free ==

We should strip all comments from the output to avoid lexing inconsistencies.  Known lexical errors in existing browsers include:
  * IE 6 allows nested block comments in CSS
  * IE allows conditional compilation comments in HTML and JS.


== String Literals should not appear to be markup or external entity references ==

We should not allow {{{<script>}}} inside a string literal, since if malicious code can trick the rewriter into outputting a {{{</script>}}}, it can open a new script tag whose content starts inside what the browser thinks is a safe string constant.
