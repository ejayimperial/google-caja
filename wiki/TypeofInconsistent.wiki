=typeof inconsistent for regular expressions=

==Effect==
See [http://javascript.crockford.com/remedial.html].
{{{
('function' === typeof o) !== (o instanceof Function)
}}}

==Background==
The typeof operator must return 'function' for anything that is callable.


==Assumptions==
Runtime checks based on typeof allow access to members of functions that are not allowed on normal Objects.



==Versions==
On Firefox,
{{{
'function' === (typeof /./)
}}}
On IE 6,
{{{
'object' === (typeof /./)
}}}

IE allows for some non-function callables.  On IE 6 and 7,
{{{
'object' === (typeof alert)
}}}
and similarly for many other builtins: {{{confirm}}}, {{{prompt}}}, {{{setTimeout}}}, {{{setInterval}}}, {{{clearTimeout}}}, {{{clearInterval}}}, and some of the DOM constructors such as {{{Image}}}.
