{{{
('function' === typeof o) !== (o instanceof Function)
}}}

==Background==
The typeof operator must return 'function' for anything that is callable.


==Assumptions==
Runtime checks based on typeof allow access to members of functions that are not allowed on normal Objects.



==Versions==
On Firefox,
{{{
'function' === (typeof /./)
}}}
On IE 6,
{{{
'object' === (typeof /./)
}}}
