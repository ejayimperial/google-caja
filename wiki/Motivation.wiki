#summary Why use Caja?

= Motivation =

Some websites embed code in `iframes`, and pass user data between
them. The use of these sites has thus far been limited to teenagers
and others who are comfortable with some aspects of their lives being
very public. The same development model -- where one company
provides a general storage layer for data, and third parties provide
custom interfaces and extensions - has not been extended to
systems that deal with valuable data.

This development model is promising, though. Large software companies
have to target their user-interface efforts at a mythical average
user; the high costs of researching and understanding the needs of
niches of users means that user interfaces tend to suffer from the
"lowest common denominator" effect. But there are many developers who
understand niche markets, and know how to write custom user interfaces
and workflows.

If we can safely embed third-party user interfaces and workflows into
generic backends, we can encourage a market for embedded applications
that will make the web experience much richer. Caja aims to allow that
safe embedding.
