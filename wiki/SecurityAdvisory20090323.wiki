=Caja Security Advisory 23-Mar-2009=

Ben Laurie of the Google Caja team found a serious flaw in Caja's source code translator, which would allow an attacker to bypass Caja's sandboxing mechanisms.

This is fixed in version r3349 and thereafter.

==Impact==

On versions of Caja prior to r3349 an attacker can completely bypass
Caja's security mechanisms.

==Advice==

Upgrade to a version of Caja at or after r3349.

==More Information==

See http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=1002 for
details of the attack and mitigation.

Thanks,

The Google Caja team.
