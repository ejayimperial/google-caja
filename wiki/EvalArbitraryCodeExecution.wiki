=Eval and Function Constructor allow Execution of Unrewritten Javascript=

==Effect==                                                                       
Execute arbitrary code with access to the global environment, and the local members of the stack frame in which it is called.


==Background==                                                                   
eval is described at 15.1.2.1, and parses its argument as a Program, and executes it in it's caller's environment.

The Function constructor allows creation of a function given a string body.  It will execute in the global scope as described at EcmaScript 262 section 15.3.2.1                

EcmaScript 262 specifically requires that the global eval method be assignable, so it can be replaced.  The Function constructor is available via the 'constructor' property of any function object.


==Assumptions==                                                                  
window.eval and/or the Function constructor are accessible.  The function constructor is available if any function is available and a function's constructor property is readable.                                                               


==Versions==                                                                     
All interpreters that obey the referenced sections of EcmaScript.


==Example==
