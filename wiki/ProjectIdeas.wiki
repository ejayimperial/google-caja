#summary Things you can work on if you're interested in contributing

= Project Ideas for Volunteers
  * Writing documentation.
  * Static analysis and optimization
    * Plenty of places optimization could occur 
  * Ambient-authority-to-capability membrane
    * Take a username and password for a site and attenuate that authority so it can be doled out in smaller pieces
      * Given the URL of a webpage and authentication info, rewrite the page so that all URLs point back to the rewriter (a membrane)
      * Create a taming of the site so that only whitelisted parts of the page work (allowing finer divisions than not all-or-nothing)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja-shahar/wiki/ShaharIntroduction Shahar]-related project ideas
    * Mergeable datatype library
      * datatypes should be cajolable
      * datatypes should support three-way merge
        * if it's possible for conflicts to occur, "in conflict" should be an allowed value
    * Message queue server
    * [http://waterken.sourceforge.net/web_send/ Waterken]-compatible server
      * Rhino on !AppEngine
      * Converts web-keys into Caja object references
