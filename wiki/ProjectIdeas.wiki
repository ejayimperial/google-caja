#summary Things you can work on if you're interested in contributing

= Project Ideas for Volunteers =
  * Tame popular libraries: [LibraryTaming the process of taming is described here]. Frameworks we are interested in are
    * [http://jquery.com/ jQuery]
    * [http://www.prototypejs.org/ Prototype]
    * Other suggestions are welcome. 
  * Auditor framework
    * One auditor should be able to prove that certain objects are immutable
  * Static analysis and optimization
    * Plenty of places optimization could occur 
  * Ambient-authority-to-capability membrane
    * Take a username and password for a site and attenuate that authority so it can be doled out in smaller pieces
      * Given the URL of a webpage and authentication info, rewrite the page so that all URLs point back to the rewriter (a membrane)
      * Create a taming of the site so that only whitelisted parts of the page work (allowing finer divisions than not all-or-nothing)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja-shahar/wiki/ShaharIntroduction Shahar]-related [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja-shahar/wiki/ProjectIdeas project ideas]
