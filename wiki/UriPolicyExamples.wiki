#summary example URI policies

= URI Policy Examples =

Below are examples of interesting URI policies and how they can be implemented.

It depends on the [http://codereview.appspot.com/1229046/show URI policy] definitions of URI effect and loader type.  As of 1 June 2010, these are pending.  (TODO: remove this caveat once the change is submitted).

TODO: rewrite these examples in JavaScript once the JS->UriPolicy bridge has been implemented.
