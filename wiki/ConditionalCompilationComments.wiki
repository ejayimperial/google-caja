=Conditional compilation may allow disabling of runtime checks.=

==Effect==
Unsanitized code can be embedded in comments, and conditional compilation might disable runtime assertions.


==Background==
IE contains a non-standard javascript extension that embeds code in comments.

According to [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/121hztk3.aspx]
    Conditional compilation allows the use of new JScript language features without sacrificing compatibility with older versions that do not support the features.

    Conditional compilation is activated by using the {{{@cc_on}}} statement, or using an {{{@if}}} or {{{@set}}} statement. Some typical uses for conditional compilation include using new features in JScript, embedding debugging support into a script, and tracing code execution.

    Always place conditional compilation code in comments, so that hosts (like Netscape Navigator) that do not understand conditional compilation will ignore it. Here is an example.


==Assumptions==
Rewritten source code includes comments or conditional compilation is supported outside comments without being rewritten into equivalent javascript control structures.


==Versions==
IE


==Example==
{{{
//@cc_on alert(document.cookie); @/ //@cc_on alert(document.cookie);
}}}
