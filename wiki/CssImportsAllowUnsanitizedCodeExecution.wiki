= {{{@import}}} can import unsanitized CSS =

==Effect==
Allows import of arbitrary CSS which can execute arbitrary javascript.


==Background==
In a CSS file {{{<style>}}} tag, an {{{@import}}} declaration can be used to import styles from an external source specified by a URL relative to the URL of the CSS or HTML file containing.the {{{@import}}}.

The {{{data:}}} protocol can be used to specify inline content in some browsers.


==Assumptions==
{{{@import}}} is allowed in style tags or third party CSS files and is not restricted to known safe CSS.


==Versions==
All


==Example==
Expression is IE specific, but the same could be applied to {{{-moz-binding}}} in Firefox.  IE 7 does not support {{{data:}}} urls.
{{{
<style>
@import "data:text/css;charset=UTF-8,p%7Bwidth%3Aexpression%28alert%281%29%29%7D";
</style>
}}}

An {{{@import}}} with a HTTP url will also allow importing of unsanitized CSS.
