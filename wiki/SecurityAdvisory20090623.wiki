=Caja Security Advisory 23-Jun-2009=

  # Felix Lee of Yahoo! found a flaw in Caja's wrappers of the browser DOM API that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with full access to the containing page. 
  # In the process, Mark Miller of Google noted the risk of a known issue whereby an attacker may be able to construct a fake DOM wrapper object and possibly trick Caja into providing them with powerful objects not otherwise provided to sandboxed code. Subsequently, Felix Lee of Yahoo! discovered a method to escalate this into a full breach on Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7.

Both vulnerabilities affect Caja version r3132 (submitted Dec 12, 
2008) or later. They are both fixed in version r3545 and thereafter. 

==Impact==

These vulnerabilities allow attacking sandboxed code to completely 
bypass all Caja's protections. 

==Advice==

Upgrade to a version of Caja at or after r3545.

==More Information==
