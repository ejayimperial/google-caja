#summary How to run the jQuery tests cajoled.

Short version: look at experimental/jquery/test/hostpage.html in your browser.

Long version:

The "caja" directory under experimental/jquery/test should really be a pointer to ant-www/testbed.  Fix that if you want by deleting the caja directory and using ln -s instead.

experimental/jquery/test/hostpage.html is a minimalist framework for hosting a single gadget, the cajoled jquery test gadget.

experimental/jquery/test/index.html is the original, uncajoled test page.

experimental/jquery/test/index2.html is a modified version that gets rid of some things that caja can't do yet

I ran 
{{{
cajole_html -i index2.html -a -r sidebyside
}}}
to get index2.js, the cajoled suite of tests.  If you have to change something in the testing stuff, be sure to recajole, since the supporting scripts are all inlined.
