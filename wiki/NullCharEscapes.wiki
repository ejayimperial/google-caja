=Null characters in URL can disguise protocols such as {{{javascript:}}}.=

==Effect==
Unsanitized code can be embedded in comments, and conditional compilation might disable runtime assertions.


==Background==
RFC 3986 allows the following characters in a URI scheme:
{{{
scheme      = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )
}}}



[http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4078] talks about wider exploits due to null bytes %00 in URLs.



==Assumptions==
URL html attribute not stripped of null characters, or urls not restricted to absolute urls with a whitelisted protocol.


==Versions==
IE


==Example==
{{{
<iframe src="java&#65533;script:alert(42)"></iframe>
}}}
