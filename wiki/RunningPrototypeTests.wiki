Get a copy of Caja from subversion.

  # {{{ant jars}}}
  # {{{cd experimental/prototype}}}
  # {{{rake caja:cajole_gadgets CAJA_SRC_PATH=../..}}} (yes, you need Ruby and rake)
  # you will find in {{{test/unit/tmp}}} a bunch of html pages and javascript and logs. Read the logs to see compile-time errors. Load the HTML in your favourite browser (== FF3 with Firebug) and enjoy. Start with truth_test.
