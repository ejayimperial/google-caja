#summary Security Advisory 20 Feb 2009
=Caja Security Advisory 20-Feb-2009=

Mark Miller of the Google Caja team found a serious flaw in Caja's
JSON implementation, which, if exploited, would allow an
attacker to bypass Caja's sandboxing mechanisms.

This is fixed in version r3282 and thereafter.

==Impact==

On versions of Caja prior to r3282 an attacker can completely bypass
Caja's security mechanisms.

==Advice==

Upgrade to a version of Caja at or after r3282.

==More Information==

See http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=978 for
details of the attack and mitigation.

Thanks,

The Google Caja team.
