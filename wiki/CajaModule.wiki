#summary Definition of a Caja Module

= Caja Modules =

A [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/ Caja] module is the output of the Caja sanitizer, or [CajaCajole cajoler].  It is a javascript function of the form 
{{{
  function(___, IMPORTS___) {
    // ...   
  }
}}}
that (currently--we're reserving this for potential later use) returns undefined.  The code is guaranteed to obey [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_capability_model object capabilities] rules.

At the moment, the most common kind of Caja module is one produced from an [http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/ OpenSocial] gadget spec, but anyone can write a container to [HostingModules host Caja modules].
