#summary defining and calling functions in Caja

= Species of Functions =

Caja distinguishes different kinds of functions since different functions can do different things.

*Constructors* are used to create new objects, and act as both class and factory.  Constructors can chain to their superclass, and manipulate the created objects {{{protected}}} interface via {{{this}}}.  Any named function that mentions {{{this}}} is a constructor.
{{{
function ClassName(a, b) {
  BaseClass.call(this, a);
  this.b_ = b;  // define a private field
}
}}}

*Methods* are functions attached to a particular class that can manipulate the {{{protected}}} interface of instances of that class via {{{this}}}.  Any unnamed function that mentions {{{this}}} is a method.
{{{
caja.def(ClassName, SuperClass, {
  setB: function (b) { this.b_ = b; },
  getB: function () { return this.b_; }
});
}}}

*Simple* functions don't have access to any object's {{{protected}}} interface, but can do anything else.  Any function that doesn't mention {{{this}}} is simple.
{{{
function foo(x, y) { return x + y; }
}}}


== Calling Functions ==

A function can be declared any of the ways above, but calling is more flexible.
