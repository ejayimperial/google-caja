#summary "Cajoling" is what we call the process of turning Caja input into !JavaScript.

=Decide what you want to cajole=

Caja turns a piece of Web content -- roughly, a snippet of HTML, CSS and !JavaScript that you would see within the `body` tag of an HTML page -- into a Caja _module_. This module is represented as a single !JavaScript _module function_ that can be run within a Caja container. (The module function builds the supplied HTML and CSS dynamically.) Caja supports two popular input sources:

*!OpenSocial.* Caja accepts an [http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/ OpenSocial] [http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/spec.html gadget], producing as its output a similar gadget with a single `script` tag containing the module function.

*Plain HTML.* When given a bare snippet of HTML content (including CSS, and !JavaScript `script` tags), Caja will produce a single !JavaScript file containing the module function.

=Obtain a Caja build=

To cajole your input, first build Caja from source.

*Download.* The source is in [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source SVN]. We assume you have downloaded it to a directory called:
{{{
./google-caja
}}}

*Compile.* Ensure you have version 1.7 of Apache [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant]. Then compile as follows:
{{{
cd google-caja/src
ant jars
}}}
You should now have a directory called `ant-jars`, relative to your current directory. Go back to your `google-caja` directory:
{{{
cd ..
}}}

=Cajole your input=

*!OpenSocial.* To cajole an !OpenSocial gadget, do the following:

{{{
bin/cajole_gadget -i <sourceGadgetUrl> -o <targetGadgetFile>
}}}

where:

  _<sourceGadgetUrl>_ - The absolute URL of a gadget spec, such as `http://example.com/listfriends.xml` or `file:/Users/example/listfriends.xml`.

  _<targetGadgetFile>_ - The file path where you want your Cajoled gadget spec to be stored, such as `./listfriends-cajoled.xml`.

*!Plain HTML.* To cajole a plain HTML snippet, do the following:

{{{
bin/cajole_html -i <inputHtmlUrl> -o <targetJsFile>
}}}

where:

  _<inputHtmlFile>_ - The absolute URL of the input HTML snippet, such as `file:/Users/example/test.html`.

  _<targetJsFile>_ - The file path where you want your JavaScript module function to be stored, such as `./test-cajoled.js`.
