To cajole an [http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/ OpenSocial] gadget spec into a [CajaModule Caja module], do the following --

# Download source from [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source SVN]. We assume you have downloaded it to a directory called `google-caja`.

# Build the code by doing the following:

{{{
cd google-caja/src
