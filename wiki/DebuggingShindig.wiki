#summary How to debug cajoled gadgets in Shindig

  # Check Shindig out.
  # Build it:
{{{
mvn clean
mvn
}}}
  # Run it:
{{{
mvn -Prun
}}}
  # Once it runs you should see which port it puts itself on (usually 8080).
  # Browse to http://localhost:8080/gadgets/files/samplecontainer/samplecontainer.html and make sure gadgets work at all.
  # If that all works ok, then check Caja out.
  # (Optional) In {{{caja/build.xml}}} replace every instance of "minify" with "pretty" - this will mean you can see original code in Shindig instead of minified code (see [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=1004 issue 1004] for whether this is still needed.
  # Each time you modify Caja, build:
{{{
ant jars
}}}
  # Copy Caja into Shindig's Maven repository
{{{
cp ant-jars/pluginc.jar ~/.m2/repository/caja/caja/r3164/caja-r3164.jar 
}}}
  # Rebuild and rerun Shindig:
{{{
mvn && mvn -Prun
}}}
  or, optionally, without tests (much faster, but still slow)
{{{
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true && mvn -Prun
}}}
  Just this step is sufficient if all you have changed is Shindig.
  # Shift-reload the gadget container in your browser - a simple reload doesn't always seem to get your updates.
  # It also helps to uncheck "Cache".
  # On the browser, it can be helpful to open the gadget frame in a new tab, add {{{&debug=1}}} to the URL (before the {{{#}}}) and shift-reload.
  # With luck, you will now be fully equipped for debugging at all levels.
