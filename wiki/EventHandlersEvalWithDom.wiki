=Event handlers execute in a scope that binds globals to DOM Properties=

==Effect==
A DOM node may be manipulated by global assignment in a way that could execute unsanitized javascript.


==Background==
DOM Level 2 defines [http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings event handlers] to allow scripts to fire when an OS event occurs in the context of a node.

These handlers are typically snippets of javascript that execute in an environment that provides access to the {{{event}}} being handled, and bind {{{this}}} to the DOM node.

Some browsers also provide global bindings for DOM node fields.


==Assumptions==
DOM event handlers are allowed and execute in the normal scope and global assignment is allowed.


==Versions==
IE


==Example==
{{{
<a onclick="URL=name" name="javascript:alert('hello')">clicky</a>
}}}
