=CSS allows execution of unsanitized javascript?=

==Effect==
On older browsers, crafted CSS stylesheets can execute unsanitized javascript in the global scope.



==Background==
CSS includes several mechanisms for changing the surrounding markup and executing expressions.

The {{{content:}}} property allows text to be added around the modified node.

E also has an extension that allows execution of arbitrary javascript.  The {{{expression}}} property is described at [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537634.aspx]

    Using the power of dynamic properties, it is now possible to declare property values not only as constants, but also as formulas.
    ...
    For scripting, a dynamic property can be any legal JScript or Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) statement.

==Assumptions==
Untrusted code can generate style elements or style attributes or otherwise add arbitrary CSS rules and create DOM elements that trigger those rules.


==Versions==
IE 5, 6.


==Example==
{{{
<div id="oDiv" style="left:expression(alert("hello"), 0)">
Example DIV
</div>
}}}
