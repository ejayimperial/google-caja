#summary How to contribute code to Caja

= Introduction =

To contribute to Caja, you will need to install python2.4 and gvn.

= Directory structure =

Use the following directory structure for your changes:

{{{
 svn-changes
     |
     +----my-change-1
     |        |
     |        +----google-caja
     |                 |
     |                 +----src
     |
     +----my-change-2
              |
              +----google-caja
                       |
                       +----src
}}}

In this way, the myvn script you will use for creating and submitting changelists can provide a changelist name for you for common commands.  For example, `myvn change` will behave like `gvn change -c my-change-1` if run under `svn-changes/my-change-1/google-caja` as will other gvn commands like `mail`, `describe` and `snapshot` unless a changelist name is explicitly provided.

= Life of a Changelist =

  # Create a client directory
{{{
$ mkdir -p svn-changes/my-change-name
}}}
  # Checkout the src
{{{
$ cd svn-changes/my-change-name
$ myvn checkout
$ cd google-caja/
}}}
  # Muck around with some source files
{{{
      See Eclipse steps below
}}}
  # Prepare a changelist
{{{
$ myvn change
}}}
    Should pop up an editor.  Check the `EDITOR`, or `SVNEDITOR` environment
    variables if it doesn't
  # Send it off for review
{{{
$ myvn mail --reviewers your-friendly-neighborhood-cajador@gmail.com
}}}
    This will automatically CC google-caja-discuss
  # File a bug to track the review
{{{
$ myvn bug
}}}
    and copy and paste the url into your browser.
  # Update your changes based on feedback and snapshot
{{{
$ myvn snapshot
}}}
  # Maybe add or remove files
{{{
$ myvn change
}}}
  # Commit the change
{{{
$ myvn submit
}}}
  # Show the change description
{{{
$ myvn describe
}}}
  # Delete the change branch
{{{
$ myvn change --delete
}}}

= Eclipse =

  # Generate the project
{{{
$ myvn eclipse
}}}
  # Open Eclipse
  # Choose New Java Project
  # From Existing Source
  # Enter the .../svn-changes/my-change-1/google-caja/ path
  # Finish
  # Build some stuff
{{{
$ ant
}}}
  # Test stuff
    Right click on project and select "Run As" > "JUnit Test"
{{{
$ ant runtests
}}}

= Other Commands =

  * `changed`      -  files changed in the snapshotted CL.  Pipeable to xargs
  * `diffstats`    -  number of lines added/changed/removed
  * `files`        -  files changed in svn.  Pipeable to xargs 
  * `filetypes`    -  sets `svn:mime-type` of modified files based on file suffix
