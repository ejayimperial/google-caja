#summary Broad overview of creating host pages.
#labels Draft

*DRAFT* - This page is incomplete and may contain incorrect information.

So you want to write a host page — a web page which contains Caja modules. 

This page is intended to give a broad overview of the major moving parts, with enough technical detail to make informed choices.

Terminology note: A host page is any web page that embeds cajoled content and therefore uses the Caja runtime. A _container_ is a web site/application which works with Caja [CajaLexicon gadgets] and therefore serves host pages.

== Types of [CajaCajole Cajoling] ==

There are two ways cajoled code may be represented in the data sent to a browser:

  * as a HTML file and !JavaScript file; the HTML is included in the host page by the server and the !JavaScript referenced by a {{{<script>}}} element. This is the default mode of operation of the command-line cajoler.
	
  * as a single !JavaScript file. In this case, the first thing the cajoled code does is generate the HTML it originally came in (as if, but not actually, by {{{document.write}}}). To produce this type of output from the command-line {{{cajole_html}}}, use the {{{--only_js_emitted}}} option.

The second method is simpler, because it does not involve any dynamic content generation or build system to include the cajoler output in the host page. However, it means that if what is being cajoled is HTML+scripting rather than something necessarily requiring !JavaScript, the HTML will not show up at all if the browser has !JavaScript disabled since loading of the HTML occurs through the Caja runtime.

For further information on running the cajoler, see CajaCajole.

== Cajita, Domita, and Valija ==

*Cajita* is the basic "secure !JavaScript" language and runtime which almost everything else uses.

*Domita* is a _[CajaLexicon taming]_ and virtualization of the DOM. Each gadget in a web page gets control over the contents of a specific element; Domita arranges this by presenting the element _as if_ it were the {{{<body>}}} of an independent HTML document (the "virtual document body" or "vdoc body"); it provides a 'document' object which is given to the gadget.

In order to accomplish its virtualization, Domita uses some special id and class names. If you set up Domita explicitly, you will provide an `idSuffix` of the form `-foo___`. Every element ID defined by the gadget is suffixed with this value. Furthermore, the vdoc body has two special class names applied: the `idSuffix` without the hyphen, which is used to mark the root element so that the virtualized `element.parentNode` can go that far up by no farther, and `vdoc-body___`.

The host page should have a stylesheet with the rule “{{{.vdoc-body___ { position: relative; overflow: auto;} }}}” (or {{{overflow: hidden;}}}); the first declaration ensures that CSS absolute positioning within the virtual document is relative to its own root rather than the whole page (and is therefore for the benefit of the gadget), and the second ensures that the gadget cannot have any visible content anywhere else on the page. This is available in Caja's files as "caja-gadget.css".

*Valija* is an emulation layer, built on top of the Cajita language, which provides a virtualized ES3 (!JavaScript) environment for running code that is unaware of Caja. For example, in Cajita you can't modify Object.prototype, but in Valija you can modify your own virtual copy of it.

It is also possible for a module to have no HTML in it at all, such as if it were a !JavaScript library.

== The Cajita runtime and Caja's JavaScript files. ==

The Cajita runtime, in order to implement the taming and other features, must add properties to Object.prototype and many other objects. This can interfere with existing code. We are therefore moving away from loading the Cajita runtime into host pages, but rather (transparently) loading it and all cajoled code into an iframe, then giving it access to the DOM in the host page. The examples linked from this page all use this technique, but it is also possible to load Caja into the host page and this can be useful for some use cases (if you want to synchronously load a Caja module before the rest of your page finishes loading).

So, load `caja.js` (`http://caja.appspot.com/caja.js`, `src/com/google/caja/plugin/caja.js`), and take a look at CajaRuntimeFiles if you care about the other option.

== Loading Caja and loading modules ==

Since `caja.js` loads Caja in an iframe, we have to wait for the iframe itself to load -- and for that matter wait for the enough of the page DOM to be ready so that the iframe can be constructed. Therefore, a host page does something like this (from container-trivial.html):

{{{
  ...
  <script src="caja.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <script type="text/javascript">
    loadCaja(function (caja) {
      // ... Do stuff with 'caja' ...
    });
  </script>
}}}

`loadCaja` is defined by `caja.js` and constructs an iframe, then calls the provided callback function. The Caja runtime is loaded into the iframe from a _Caja server_ (defaulting to our `caja.appspot.com` so getting started is simple) which is also used for dynamically cajoling code.

Once Caja is loaded, modules may be loaded using the `caja.hostTools.Sandbox` utility; see HostTools for the API, or read the examples below.

== Host page examples ==

These two examples use the above-described “single !JavaScript file” format of cajoled gadgets.

  * An utterly trivial example: [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/demos/container/container-trivial.html container-trivial.html]. This does nothing but load and display a gadget.

  * Multiple gadgets, with interaction between them, are demonstrated in [http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/demos/container/container-interaction.html container-interaction.html]. The wiki page InteractingModulesExample explains an older version of this page which did not use caja.js.

This example is a container site which embeds cajoled HTML, and therefore actually invokes the cajoling service from its own server:

  * The Caja [http://caja-corkboard.appspot.com corkboard demo] is an example of using Caja to sandbox, not explicitly authored "gadgets", but rather whatever random HTML a user of your site types in (e.g. in blog comments, forum posts, user profiles, ...).
