ajax_test

	Heavily reliant on as yet unimplemented TameXMLHTTPRequest().


array_test: 20 tests, 98 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


dollar_test:test$

	Fails because getElementById returns a different object each
	time, even if the underlying node is the
	same. http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=911.


base_test:testObjectToJSON

	http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=901

base_test:testBindAsEventListener:

	http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/issues/detail?id=908


element_mixins_test:testEvent

	Fails because attributes can't be set on tame nodes.

element_mixins_test:testCollections

	Fails. Reason not yet determined.


enumerable_test:testEnumContext

	Fails because it tries to compare to nonexistent this.min and
	so throws. I believe it would also fail uncajoled, but not
	tested.

enumerable_test:testGrep

	Fails because it uses selector.js:Selector.initialize(), which
	uses eval() because neither XPath (document.evaluate()) nor
	Selectors API (document.querySelector()) are available. It may
	be possible to make the default scheme
	(selector.js:Select.compileMatcher()) work without eval(), too.


grep_test ... all pass.


truth_test ... all pass.
