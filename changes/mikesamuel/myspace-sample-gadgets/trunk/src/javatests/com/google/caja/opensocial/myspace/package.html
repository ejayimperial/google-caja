Here's the source for 6 of the top MySpace gadgets. These can be used
for Caja testing and integrated into the internal Caja test suite if you
wish.</p>

These gadgets do not use external script includes created by the
developer, use external libraries such as prototype, or create new
IFRAMES within the gadget, so I think they should be good initial
candidates for testing Caja. If these pass, I can send you some gadgets
to test that use external includes, which may present more issues for
the Caja compiler.</p>
